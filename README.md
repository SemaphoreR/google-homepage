Welcome welcome welcome!

This is Semaphore's first HTML/CSS project with The Odin Project. The goal is to create a page that looks (but does not replicate the functionality of) the Google homepage. There will be no JavaScript nonsense here. That sorcery will be included in later projects, after I have sold my soul for the ability to produce it.

For now, enjoy the Google branding.
